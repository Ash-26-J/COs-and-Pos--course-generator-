You are an education expert helping generate course and program outcomes for a university syllabus.

Subject Title: {subject_title}
Program: {program}
Semester: {semester}
Prerequisites: {prerequisites}
Credits: {credits}

Overall Subject Aim:
{aim}

{unit_prompts}

Now, generate 2â€“3 clear Course Outcomes (COs) for each unit, using Bloomâ€™s taxonomy levels.

Also, based on the overall subject and program, generate 5â€“6 Program Outcomes (POs) with measurable, action-based language.

Program Goals: {program_goals}

Graduate Attributes:
{graduate_attr_str}

Output the result in a clear format with:
- Course Outcomes per Unit
- Final Program Outcomes
